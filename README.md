**# Movie Recommendation System With Python And Pandas**

In this project walkthrough, we'll learn how to create a movie recommendation system using Jupyter, Python, and Pandas. By the end, we'll be able to type the name of a movie into an input box, and instantly get recommendations for other movies we might like.

We'll start with the MovieLens 25M dataset, which contains movie reviews and ratings. Then, we'll build a search engine to find a specific movie title in our data. We'll then be able to create a recommendation engine to recommend specific movies.
